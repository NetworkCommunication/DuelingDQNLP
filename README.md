# DuelingDQNLP
UAV_MEC_env.py is the environment for agent interaction.  
RL_brain_dueling.py contains DQN, DDQN and DuelingDQN.  
Run_uav_mec_task_2.py contains the main function, which is the running entry of the DuelingDQNLP. After running, the .npy files corresponding to each variable are generated. Then, we get them in compare_Dueling_DQN_Double_\*.py for comparison experiment. 
Compare_Dueling_DQN_Double_\*.py are the comparison experiments.
We need to put the .npy files in the corresponding file path, and then run the Compare_Dueling_DQN_Double_\*.py.
