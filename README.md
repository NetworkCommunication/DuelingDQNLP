UAV_MEC_env.py is the environment for agent interaction.  
RL_brain_dueling.py contains DQN, DDQN and DuelingDQN.  
Run_uav_mec_task_2.py contains the main function, which is the running entry of the DuelingDQNLP. After running, the files corresponding to each variable are generated. Then, we get them in compare_Dueling_DQN_Double_\*.py for comparison experiment.
